# KDFork

KDFork is a fork of kdmapper the tool that orignally exploited iqvw64e.sys the Intel driver to manually map non-signed drivers in memory,  
I have updated the vulnerable driver, and also ported the VDM library to allow for switching vulnerable driver almost instantly.  

## ToDo  

The codebase isnt tidy, and I will rework it soon to make following the execution easier.
